                         <h2>Check Your Battery</h2>
                         <p> Have you noticed how aware we all are of our cell phone charge levels — while basically ignoring our own?! It’s so easy to keep pushing, pushing, pushing without recharging. And, if we keep that up long enough, our bodies, minds and spirits will inevitably shut down. </p>
                         <p> Below you’ll find a simple focusing tool created with the thought that becoming more conscious of our energy levels can be a great first step toward taking better care of ourselves — being clear on where we are helps us get and stay where we want to be.</p>
                         <p>To give it a try, slide the battery charge level to match how you feel. Then click on PERSPECTIVE to get just that. Use this tool as often as you like ... we built it just to help you take care of you.</p>
